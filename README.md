CodeFull Toolkit
==========

Leveraging the power of the [OpenTK library] (http://www.opentk.com/), this toolkit contains a bunch of mesh visualization tools. Currently it contains a Windows Forms control called GLViewport3D, an extension of OpenTK's GLControl and an attempt to create a better WPF Viewport3D alternative. GLViewport3D is able to quickly render triangular meshes with millions of vertices and manipulate them. The meshes could be imported from mesh PLY files.

## Usage
An example project is available in the solution directory. The example demonstrates the mesh. Try loading the "chair-simplified.ply" file located under the "files" folder under the "Example" project. The mesh was obtained using Kinect Fusion v2.

## Acknowledgement
This library became possible with [OpenTK] (http://www.opentk.com/).
